**Vellum** is a **Minecraft: Bedrock Server** (BDS) backup and map-rendering **automation tool** by [**clarkx86**](https://github.com/clarkx86) and contributors, primarily made to create incremental backups and render interactive maps of your world using [**PapyrusCS**](https://github.com/mjungnickel18/papyruscs).

## What is this fork?
This is where I store changes to Vellum that I've made for my own use including:
* Pull requests for issues in the main repository
* Early merging-in of other people's pull requests on the main repo that would be useful to my server
* Adding functionality to Vellum to take advantage of [**ElementZero**](https://github.com/Element-0/ElementZero), a version of BDS that adds many features.

## What is different so far?
* Use ElementZero bus to sync chats between multiple servers running on the same machine
* Connect to a Discord bot to sync chat with a Discord channel
* Fixed notification before shutting down to render or backup
* Early merge in of [**BDS process watchdog**](https://github.com/clarkx86/vellum/pull/10) by [**bennydiamond**](https://github.com/bennydiamond)

## How should I contribute?
If your contribution is not related to the interaction of Vellum and ElementZero specifically, please contribute to the [**main repository**](https://github.com/clarkx86/vellum/) instead.

## Will there be any downloadable releases for this fork?
Not at this time. The intention is that only people who really really need the functionality I've made for myself will pay any attention to this.  Everyone else should visit the main repo.

## License?
Vellum has not selected a license at the time of writing.  I have obtained permission for what's going on here.
