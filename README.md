**Vellum** is a **Minecraft: Bedrock Server** (BDS) backup and map-rendering **automation tool** by [**clarkx86**](https://github.com/clarkx86) and contributors, primarily made to create incremental backups and render interactive maps of your world using [**PapyrusCS**](https://github.com/mjungnickel18/papyruscs).

## What is this fork?
This is where I store changes to Vellum that I've made for my own use including:
* Pull requests for issues in the main repository
* Early merging-in of other people's pull requests on the main repo that would be useful to my server
* Adding functionality to Vellum to take advantage of [**ElementZero**](https://github.com/Element-0/ElementZero), a version of BDS that adds many features.

## What is different so far?
* Use ElementZero bus to sync chats between multiple servers
* Connect to a Discord bot to sync chat with a Discord channel
  * Create Discord mentions within Minecraft by using `@<User Name>` -- with the <> included
* Fixed notification before shutting down to render or backup
* Early merge in of [**BDS process watchdog**](https://github.com/clarkx86/vellum/pull/10) by [**bennydiamond**](https://github.com/bennydiamond)

## How should I contribute?
Everyone is encouraged to contribute to the [**main repository**](https://github.com/clarkx86/vellum) over this one.  Any suggestions for features that don't require ElementZero should definitely go over there.

If you encounter any problems using this version though, please use the issue tracker here. If it turns out to be a problem with the main codebase, the issue will be closed here and directed over there.

## Linux version?
Since ElementZero only runs on the Windows version of BDS, a Linux version of this fork wouldn't make sense.

## License?
Vellum has not selected a license at the time of writing.  I have obtained permission for what's going on here.
